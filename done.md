    - Learned a lot about `Command-Line Arguments`.
    - Learned a lot about working with the File System in C++ using `fstream` and `filesystem`
    - Improved my knowledge on catching exceptions.
    - Really tried to hammer in good practices and modern C++ idioms, though it's obviously a WIP.
- Fixed a bunch of VS Code config issues and updated `settings.json` to work with Clang.
- Switched from using `GCC` to `Clang`.
- Downloaded and started using the `GitHub CLI`.
- Created a C++ starter template GitHub template project - **[cpp_starter_template](https://github.com/pointerchain/cpp_starter_template)**
    - Learned about CMakePresets.json
- Took a break but I am now getting back on the grind.

## 2025-10-23

- Successfully created a C++ solution for the LeetCode problem, `Valid Parentheses` - **[0020_valid_parentheses](https://github.com/pointerchain/leetcode_solutions/tree/8c25db692b95652fcd13c8f23d0b1e2f6ece3e13/0020_valid_parentheses)**
    - Learned about `std::stack`.
- Installed the terminal multiplexer `zellij`.

- Learned about proper naming conventions according to the Google Style Guide for C++.
- Read the second chapter of `A Tour of C++ Third Edition by Bjarne Stroustrup`.
- Did some research into `neovim`, thinking about switching from `VS Code` to `neovim`.
- Successfully created a C++ solution for the LeetCode problem, `Roman to Integer` - **[0013_roman_to_integer](https://github.com/pointerchain/leetcode_solutions/tree/d6a34cbe57ccabfb61d802cff7e15f18fc7833f0/0013_roman_to_integer)**

## 2025-10-21

- Successfully created my first C++ solution for a LeetCode problem, `Two Sum` - **[0001_two_sum](https://github.com/pointerchain/leetcode_solutions/tree/8648d6acc5e577919ba518c975ee7280c1dd08df/0001_two_sum)**
- Made a GitHub repo for LeetCode solutions - **[leetcode_solutions](https://github.com/pointerchain/leetcode_solutions)**
- Updated/Refactored the `C++ Rock Paper Scissors`, moving over to **C++23** from **C++20** - **[cpp_rock_paper_scissors](https://github.com/pointerchain/cpp_rock_paper_scissors/tree/17006e4f783e4b4259da433b7e74fd3c9b11a0bf)**
    - Took me around 15 minutes to update it. Was planning on sticking out C++20 and under for a little while but decided to just go to C++23 because I think it will be more beneficial in the long run.
    - Learned about using `std::print`, `std::println`, and `std::unreachable`.
- Created a console based `C++ Rock Paper Scissors` application - **[cpp_rock_paper_scissors](https://github.com/pointerchain/cpp_rock_paper_scissors/tree/2c349137b2d187d980a3bcf6dd214c399e72a099)**.
    - Took me around an hour and a half to write, felt happy with the results.
    - Learned about `std::unordered_map`, practiced using `enum class`, learned how to use `static` local variables effectively, and a lot more.
    - Learned a lot about modern ways to generate random numbers, using `std::random_device`, `std::mt19937`, and `std::uniform_int_distribution`.

- Spent most of the day taking care of my dog after he had his teeth pulled.
- Read the first chapter of `A Tour of C++ Third Edition by Bjarne Stroustrup`.

## 2025-10-19

    - This was my first project using the complete workflow, and I'm proud of how it went.
    - Took me around 45 minutes to write, actually had a good amount of fun and went pretty smoothly.
    - Learned a lot about how to properly use `std::cin`, how to write good *robust* and *safe* code.
    - Got some good practice with just good *control flow* and *minimizing variable scope*. 
- Practiced making `CMakeLists.txt` from scratch; got comfortable with it after a few projects.
- Practiced C++ project creation workflow (`mkdir` -> `git init` -> `mkdir src include build` -> etc).
- Installed `alacritty` and set up as default terminal emulator over the prepackaged one.
- Re-setup all of Fedora environment, installing packages and fixing configs.
